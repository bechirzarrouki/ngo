    <h1>Our Challenges</h1>
    
    <div>
      <h2>1. Funding and Sustainability</h2>
      <p>
        One of our primary challenges is securing consistent funding to support our mission. 
        InnovMatch aims to provide free access to resources and connections, but this requires 
        financial backing. We focus on building sustainable partnerships and exploring diverse 
        revenue streams to ensure that our platform can continue to operate and expand its reach 
        effectively.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>2. User Engagement and Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Attracting users is just the first step; keeping them engaged over time is crucial. 
        InnovMatch works to build meaningful connections between job seekers, innovators, and investors. 
        We strive to develop a user-friendly experience with regular updates, personalized features, 
        and community engagement initiatives to maintain user interest and loyalty.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Digital Literacy, Infrastructure, and Access</h2>
      <p>
        Many potential users, particularly in underserved communities, face challenges with digital 
        literacy and limited access to technology. InnovMatch aims to address this by providing 
        easy-to-use interfaces, partnering with local organizations to offer training, and exploring 
        ways to make our platform accessible even in areas with low internet connectivity.
